<b>Angular Inertia in 2D</b> <br>
<br>
When doing 2D rigid body physics, we use a constant called the <i>moment of inertia</i> for each body, which describes how resistant that body is to being rotated.&nbsp; 
Treating our rigid body as a collection of point masses, its moment of inertia, 
which we will call <i>i</i>, 
is:</p>

    <td width="88%">
    <img border="0" src="./inertia_files/01.png" width="167" height="82"></td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>r is just the distance of each point from the center of mass.&nbsp; To find r<sup>2</sup>, 
we find the vector <b>r</b> from the center of mass to each point, and 
dot-product that vector with itself:</p>

<p><b>Angular Inertia in 3D</b></p>
<p>Though it's a little bit more complex, the 3D case is a straightforward 
extension from 2D.&nbsp; We're going to push on our body at some point, in some 
direction.&nbsp; This point, direction, and center of mass, together define a 
plane of rotation, and thus an axis that we are rotating around.&nbsp; (Unless 
we are pushing along a ray through the center of mass, but in that case, the 
object just doesn't rotate since there is no torque).&nbsp; We'll call the axis 
of rotation <b>a</b>.&nbsp; To simplify some upcoming math, we'll define <b>a</b> 
as being unit length.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%" id="AutoNumber1">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td width="12%">(4)&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>
    <td width="88%"><img border="0" src="./inertia_files/4.png" width="272" height="183"></td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>As in 2D, we want to compute Sum m r<sup>2</sup>, only now, r is the distance 
from the axis of rotation to the point of mass.&nbsp; We'll call each point of 
mass <b>x</b><sub>n</sub>.&nbsp; For simplicity's sake, we'll work in a 
coordinate system where the center of mass is at the origin.&nbsp; As in 2D, we 
can compute r<sup>2 </sup>as the vector dot product <b>r&#8729;r</b>, only now <b>
r</b> is the component of <b>x</b> orthogonal to <b>a</b>.&nbsp; </p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%" id="AutoNumber1">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td width="12%">(5)&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>
    <td width="88%"><img border="0" src="./inertia_files/5.png" width="284" height="264"></td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>This is simple enough to compute, and we plug it into our expression for the 
angular inertia:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%" id="AutoNumber1">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td width="12%">(6)&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>
    <td width="88%">
    <img border="0" src="./inertia_files/06.png" width="543" height="117"></td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>This equation for <i>i</i> would work fine  if we stored our body as a bunch of 
point masses, but it would be expensive to compute, as we need to iterate over 
all point masses every time we apply a force to the body.&nbsp; Though it looks 
like we can't evaluate equation 7 until we know the axis of rotation (so we can 
do those dot products), because everything in equation 7 is linear, we can 
factor the equation across all the additions, so that we're just working with a 
summary of the point masses.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%" id="AutoNumber1">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td width="12%">(8)&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>
    <td width="88%">
    <img border="0" src="./inertia_files/08.png" width="371" height="241"></td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Now, in order to combine terms so that we can factor the a out further, we 
want to promote the scalar <b>x</b><b>&#8729;</b><b>x</b> to something matrix-sized.&nbsp; We can do 
this just by wrapping it with <b>a</b><sup>T</sup> and <b>a</b>:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%" id="AutoNumber1">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td width="12%">(9)&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>
    <td width="88%">
    <img border="0" src="./inertia_files/09.png" width="464" height="296"></td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Now since the axis is constant over the summation, we can factor <b>a</b> all 
the way out:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%" id="AutoNumber1">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td width="12%">(10)&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>
    <td width="88%">
    <img border="0" src="./inertia_files/10.png" width="470" height="186"></td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>This gives us I, a 3x3 matrix that represents the angular inertia of a 3D 
body, which can be entirely precomputed.&nbsp; When it comes time to push the 
body around, we find <b>a</b>; computing <b>a</b><sup>T</sup>I<b>a</b> gives us a 
scalar that tells us how hard it is to rotate the body in that direction.</p>
<p>The way people standardly do 3D physics, they don't actually want a scalar, 
the way they do in 2D.&nbsp; The reason is that you want to remember which way 
the body is rotating.&nbsp; In 2D, we didn't have to remember, since there's 
only one plane of rotation.&nbsp; So we just skip the multiplication of <b>a</b><sup>T
</sup>on the left, and stop at I<b>a</b>.&nbsp; That gives us a vector parallel 
to the axis of rotation <b>a</b>, whose length describes how difficult it is to 
rotate that way.</p>
<p>To see this angular inertia matrix ("Tensor of Inertia") in the form that 
physics books usually write it, we can expand equation 10:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%" id="AutoNumber1">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td width="12%">(11)&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>
    <td width="88%">
    <img border="0" src="./inertia_files/11.png" width="853" height="399"></td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>but I am going to drop that like a hot potato because it leads to just the sort of 
icky symbol manipulation I'm trying to stay away from.&nbsp; It's only here to 
provide a concrete connection between this derivation and what physics books 
say.</p>
<p><b>A Mental Shift</b></p>
<p>Physics texts treat the tensor of inertia as a fundamental primitive about a 
body that you want to compute, but I don't like to see it that way.&nbsp; 
Looking at the form of the matrix, one can't help but feeling that it's a bit 
mixed up and ugly.&nbsp; And looking at equation 11, it seems we arrived at this 
ugly thing by starting with some simpler and nicer things, and subtracting one 
from the other.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Going back to the definition of I from equation 10, we can distribute the sum 
to break it into two matrices:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%" id="AutoNumber1">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td width="12%">(12)&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>
    <td width="88%">
    <img border="0" src="./inertia_files/12.png" width="401" height="231"></td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>&nbsp;(tr C indicates the trace of the matrix C)</p>
<p>So we can compute C, which has a very simple form, then convert from C to I 
any time we want.&nbsp; To me, C is  more intuitive, and deserves to be 
treated as the fundamental body primitive; I is just C with some case-specific 
manipulations folded in.&nbsp; </p>
<p>C is the 2nd moment of the mass distribution, also known as the <i>
mass-weighted covariance</i> of the body.&nbsp; You can do a lot of things with 
C besides just convert to I (for example, you can graph it).&nbsp; </p>
